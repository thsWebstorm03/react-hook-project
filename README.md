## 💡 Why? 

React custom hooks allow to abstract components' business logic into single thus reusable functions.<br />
So far, I've found that most of the hooks I've created and therefore shared between my projects have quite often a 
similar gist that involves callback references, events and React's lifecycle. <br />
For this reason I've tried to sum up that gist into `@beautiful/react-hooks`: a collection of (*hopefully*) useful 
React hooks to possibly help other developers to speed up their development process.<br /><br />
Furthermore, I've tried to create a concise yet concrete API having in mind the code readability, focusing 
to keep the learning curve as lower as possible so that the it can be used and shared in bigger teams.
