# useMouseState

Returns a summary of the mouse current position properties (such as clientX, clientY).
It accepts a DOM ref representing the events target (where attach the events to).

If a target is not provided the events will be globally attached to the `document` object.

### Why? ðŸ’¡

- allow to easily inspect the mouse position 
- takes care of adding the mouse events listeners globally or to a defined target
- takes care of cleaning the listener when the component unmounts


### Basic Usage:

Provide a DOM ref as first parameter to `useMouseState`


```jsx harmony
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { useMouseState } from 'beautiful-react-hooks'; 

const MouseReporter = () => {
  const ref = useRef();
  const { clientX, clientY } = useMouseState(ref);
  
  return (
   <DisplayDemo>
     <div ref={ref}>
       Move mouse over me to get its current coordinates:
       {clientX}, {clientY}
     </div>
   </DisplayDemo>
  );
};

<MouseReporter />
```

### Global events

Avoid providing any argument to `useMouseState`

```jsx harmony
import { useMouseState } from 'beautiful-react-hooks'; 

const MouseReporter = () => {
  const { clientX, clientY } = useMouseState(); 
  
  return (
   <DisplayDemo>
     The current mouse coordinates are:
     {clientX}, {clientY}
   </DisplayDemo>
  );
};

<MouseReporter />
```

### Mastering the hook

#### âœ… When to use

- When need to abstract touch related logics into custom hooks(s)

#### ðŸ›‘ What not to do

- You can't use the returned handler setter asynchronously, it will not have any effect but changing the handler
  possibly leading to bugs in your code.
- Absolutely avoid using `useMouseEvents` handler setters to replace the standard mouse handler props.
-  `useMouseEvents` is meant to be used to abstract more complex hooks that need to control the mouse, for example: a drag n drop hook.
- Using `useMouseEvents` handlers instead of the classic props approach it's just as bad as it sounds since you'll
  lose the React SyntheticEvent performance boost.<br />
- If you were doing something like the following, please keep doing it:

```jsx harmony static noedit
const MyComponent = (props) => {
  const { mouseDownHandler } = props;
    
  return (
    <div onMouseDown={mouseDownHandler} />
  );
};
```
