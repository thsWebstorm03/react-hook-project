# useGeolocationEvents 

Returns an object of callback setters to handle the geolocation-related events.
So far, the supported methods are: `onChange`, invoked when the position changes and `onError`, invoked when
an error occur while retrieving the position.<br/>
The returned object also contains the `isSupported` boolean flag reporting whether the geolocation API is supported.

**Please note:** the returned callback setters should invoked immediately in the function component's body, do not try to
call this functions asynchronously.

### Why? ðŸ’¡

- takes care of adding the geolocation events listeners
- takes care of cleaning the listener when the component will unmount
- allow to perform abstractions on geolocation related events

### Basic Usage:

```jsx harmony
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useGeolocationEvents } from 'beautiful-react-hooks'; 

const GeoReporter = () => {
  const [ position, setGeoPosition] = useState();
  const [ error, setError] = useState();
  const { isSupported, onChange, onError } = useGeolocationEvents({ enableHighAccuracy: true });
  
  onChange((geoPosition) => setGeoPosition(geoPosition));
  
  onError((err) => setError(err));
  
  return (
   <DisplayDemo>
     <p>Geolocation supported: {isSupported ? 'yes' : 'no'}</p>
     {!error && position && (
       <p>lat: {position.coords.latitude}, lng: {position.coords.longitude}</p>
     )}
   </DisplayDemo>
  );
};

<GeoReporter />
```

### Mastering the hooks

#### âœ… When to use
 
- If in need to abstract some geolocation related logic into a custom hooks

#### ðŸ›‘ What not to do

- You can't use the returned callback setter asynchronously, it will not have any effect but changing the callback 
 possibly leading to bugs in your code.
