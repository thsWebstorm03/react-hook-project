# useLifecycle

Accepts two functions to be performed during the component's lifecycle.
 
The first one will be fired after **component did mount**, the second right before the **component unmounts**.

### Why? ðŸ’¡

- Encloses the "lifecycle hooks" such as `useDidMount` and `useWillUnmount`;
- It's as a shortcut to `useEffect(onMount, [])` and `useEffect(() => () => willUnmount, [])`;


### Basic Usage:

```jsx harmony
import { useCallback } from 'react';
import { useLifecycle } from 'beautiful-react-hooks'; 

/**
* useDidMount example component
*/
const LifeCycleComponent = () => {   
   const onMount = useCallback(() => {
     console.log('Component did mount');
   }, []);
   
    const onUnmount = useCallback(() => {
      console.log('Component will unmount');
    }, []);
   
   useLifecycle(onMount, onUnmount); 
      
   return (
     <DisplayDemo>
       Check the javascript console
     </DisplayDemo>
   );
};

<LifeCycleComponent />
```

### Callback setter syntax:

if no parameters are provided, the returned object of handler setters can be used to 
set the `useDidMount` and `useWillUnmount` handlers, as long as they are immediately invoked.

**Please note**: the returned handler setters are meant to change the value of the callback reference only, they do not 
cause the component rerender nor should not be invoked asynchronously.

```jsx harmony
import { useLifecycle } from 'beautiful-react-hooks'; 

const ComponentDidMount = () => {
   const { onDidMount, onWillUnmount } = useLifecycle(); 
   
   onDidMount(() => {
     console.log('Component did mount');
   });
   
   onWillUnmount(() => {
     console.log('Component will unmount');
   });
      
   return (
     <DisplayDemo>
       Check the javascript console
     </DisplayDemo>
   );
};

<ComponentDidMount />
```

#### âœ… Pro tip:

When using a React function component you should not really think of it in terms of "lifecycle".

The `useLifecycle` hook is indeed intended as a shortcut to  `useEffect(onMount, [])` and 
`useEffect(() => () => willUnmount, [])`.

To deep understanding `useEffect`, what it is and how it should be properly used, please read

### Mastering the hook

#### âœ… When to use
 
- When in need of performing a function after the component did mount
- When in need of performing a function right before the component unmounts
- When in need of a shortcut to the component lifecycle

#### ðŸ›‘ When not to use

- You can't use it asynchronously since this will break the [rules of hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html)
- If using the handler setters, they should not be used asynchronously but immediately invoked.
