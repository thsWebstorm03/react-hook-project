# useMouse

Returns an array where the first item is the mouse state from [useMouseState](./useMouseState.md) and the 
second item is the object of callback setters from [useMouseEvents](./useMouseEvents.md).

It is intended as a shortcut to those hooks.

### Why? ðŸ’¡

- allow to easily receive the mouse position 
- takes care of adding the mouse events listeners globally or to the defined target
- takes care of cleaning the listener when the component will unmount
- allow to perform abstractions on mouse related events

### Basic Usage:

Provide a DOM ref as first parameter to `useMouse`

```jsx harmony
import { useRef, useState } from 'react';
import { useMouse } from 'beautiful-react-hooks'; 

const MouseReporter = () => {
  const ref = useRef();
  const [ showCoords, setShowCoords] = useState(false);
  const [position, { onMouseEnter, onMouseLeave }] = useMouse(ref); 
  
  onMouseEnter(() => setShowCoords(true));
  onMouseLeave(() => setShowCoords(false));
  
  return (
    <DisplayDemo>
     <div ref={ref}>
       Move mouse over me to get its current coordinates:
       {showCoords && (
         <p>{position.clientX}, {position.clientY}</p>
       )}
     </div>
    </DisplayDemo>
  );
};

<MouseReporter />
```

### Global events

Avoid providing any argument to `useMouse`

```jsx harmony
import { useRef, useState } from 'react';
import { useMouse } from 'beautiful-react-hooks'; 

const MouseReporter = () => {
  const ref = useRef();
  const [ mouseIsOver, setMouseHover] = useState(false);
  const [position, { onMouseEnter, onMouseLeave }] = useMouse(ref); 
  
  onMouseEnter(() => setMouseHover(true));
  onMouseLeave(() => setMouseHover(false));
  
  return (
    <DisplayDemo>
     <div ref={ref} style={{background: mouseIsOver ? '#FF4365' : 'white'}}>
       The current mouse coordinates are:
       <p>{position.clientX}, {position.clientY}</p>
     </div>
    </DisplayDemo>
  );
};

<MouseReporter />
```

### Mastering the hooks

#### âœ… When to use
 
- If in need to get the mouse current position
- If in need to abstract some mouse related logic into a custom hooks

#### ðŸ›‘ What not to do

- You can't use the returned callback setter asynchronously, it will not have any effect but changing the callback 
 possibly leading to bugs in your code.
- Absolutely avoid using `useMouse` callback setters to replace the standard mouse handler props. 
-  `useMouse` is meant to be used to abstract more complex hooks that need to control the mouse, for example: a drag n drop hook.
- Using `useMouse` handlers instead of the classic props approach it's just as bad as it sounds since you'll
lose the React SyntheticEvent performance boost.<br />
- If you were doing something like the following, please keep doing it:

```jsx harmony static noedit
const MyComponent = (props) => {
  const { mouseDownHandler } = props;
    
  return (
    <div onMouseDown={mouseDownHandler} />
  );
};
```
