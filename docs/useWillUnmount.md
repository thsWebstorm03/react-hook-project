# useWillUnmount

Accepts a function to be performed right before the component unmounts.

### Why? ðŸ’¡

- takes care of performing a callback right before the component unmounts
- It's as a shortcut to `useEffect(() => () => willUnmount, [])`;

### Basic Usage:

```jsx harmony
import { useWillUnmount } from 'beautiful-react-hooks'; 

const ComponentWillUnmount = () => {   
   useWillUnmount(() => {
      console.log('Component did unmount');
   });
      
   return (
     <DisplayDemo>
       Check the javascript console after moving from this page
     </DisplayDemo>
   );
};

<ComponentWillUnmount />
```

### Callback setter syntax:

if the first parameter is not provided, the returned function (*a callback setter*) can be used to 
set the `useWillUnmount` handler, as long as it is immediately invoked.

**Please note**: the returned callback setter is meant to change the value of the callback reference only, it does not 
cause the component rerender nor should not be invoked asynchronously.

```jsx harmony
import { useWillUnmount } from 'beautiful-react-hooks'; 

const ComponentWillUnmount = () => {
   const onUnmount = useWillUnmount(); 
   
   onUnmount(() => {
    console.log('Component did unmount');
   });
      
   return (
     <DisplayDemo>
       Check the javascript console after moving from this page
     </DisplayDemo>
   );
};

<ComponentWillUnmount />
```


#### âœ… Pro tip:

When using a React function component you should not really think of it in terms of "lifecycle".

The `useWillUnmount` hook is indeed intended as a shortcut to  `useEffect(() => () => willUnmount, [])`.

### Mastering the hooks

#### âœ… When to use
 
- When in need of performing a function after the component did mount

#### ðŸ›‘ When not to use

- You can't use it asynchronously since this will break the [rules of hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html)
- If using the callback setter, it should not be used asynchronously but immediately invoked
